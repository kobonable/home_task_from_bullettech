# Docker
# .dockerignore is used for Docker build context
# Ignore Docker-related files that are not part of the source code
# such as temporary build artifacts or generated volumes if not handled by docker-compose
# However, for this project, the volumes in docker-compose.yml handle result_data,
# so explicitly ignoring it here is also good practice.
